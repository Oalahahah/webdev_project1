    <h1>Why am i choosing programming?</h1>
    <h2>Main Reason</h2>
    <p>The main reason I chose to pursue an Informatics Engineering degree is the strong career opportunities it offers. I’m motivated by the chance to build a stable future and earn a good income through a field that continues to grow in demand.</p>
    <h2>Curent Learning Methode</h2>
    <p>Right now I’m mostly learning by watching YouTube tutorials, since they’re super easy to find and fun to follow. I also check out some free Coursera courses here and there, just to get a bit more structure. It’s a nice mix that keeps things simple but still helps me pick up new skills.</p>
    <h2>Vision on programing</h2>
    <p>I’m really ambitious about learning web development, but I also plan to take AI engineering classes at my university to future-proof myself, because of how cooked the programming job market is currently.</p>
